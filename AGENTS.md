# Agent Instructions for Kapan Finance

## Task Tracking

Use the `beads` tool for task management. Actions: `ready`, `list`, `create`, `update`, `close`, `show`, `prime`, `sync`.

Priority: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low.

## Project Context

See [PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](./PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) for architecture and guidelines.

## Skills

Skills provide specialized knowledge for specific areas. See `.opencode/skill/INDEX.md` for available skills.

Load the `skill-system` skill when:
- You completed significant work that should be documented
- You're working on code that no skill covers
- A skill gave outdated advice
- You want to create, update, or remove a skill

Skills emerge organically from work. Don't pre-create them.
