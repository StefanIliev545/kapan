# CoW Order Debugging

This skill covers how to debug Kapan's CoW Protocol limit orders, from order creation through settlement.

## Architecture Overview

```
User → MultiplyEvmModal → useCowOrder → KapanOrderManager → ComposableCoW
                                              ↓
                              KapanOrderHandler (generates GPv2 orders)
                                              ↓
                              CoW Watchtower (monitors & submits)
                                              ↓
                              FlashLoanRouter → KapanCowAdapter → Settlement
```

## Key Contracts (Base)

| Contract | Address | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| KapanOrderManager | `0x12F80f5Fff3C0CCC283c7b2A2cC9742ddf8c093A` | Stores order context, executes hooks |
| KapanOrderHandler | `0x9a503a4489ebeb2e6f13adcd28f315e972b63371` | IConditionalOrder - generates GPv2 orders |
| KapanCowAdapter | `0xF6342053a12AdBc92C03831BF88029608dB4C0B6` | Flash loan borrower, funds OrderManager |
| KapanRouter | `0xFA3B0Efb7E26CDd22F8b467B153626Ce5d34D64F` | Executes lending operations |

## Common Failure Points

### 1. OrderHandler Not Set

**Symptom**: `createOrder` reverts with `InvalidHandler()`

**Check**:
```bash
cast call <OrderManager> "orderHandler()" --rpc-url <RPC>
# Should NOT be 0x0000...0000
```

**Fix**: Run `npx hardhat deploy --tags KapanOrderHandler --network <chain>`

### 2. Order Not Registered on ComposableCoW

**Symptom**: Order created but watchtower ignores it

**Check**:
```bash
# Get order hash from OrderManager logs
cast logs --from-block <block> --address <OrderManager> --rpc-url <RPC>

# Verify on ComposableCoW
cast call 0xfdaFc9d1902f4e0b84f65F49f244b32b31013b74 \
  "singleOrders(address,bytes32)(bool)" <OrderManager> <cowOrderHash> --rpc-url <RPC>
```

### 3. EIP-1271 Signature Invalid

**Symptom**: `GPv2: invalid eip1271 signature`

**Cause**: Order parameters in signature don't match what handler returns

**Debug**:
1. Get the order from handler:
```typescript
const [order, sig] = await composableCoW.getTradeableOrderWithSignature(
  orderManagerAddr, cowParams, "0x", []
);
```
2. Compare with what you're passing to `settle()`
3. Common issue: `receiver` must ALWAYS be OrderManager, not Settlement

### 4. Missing Token Approval (PullToken fails)

**Symptom**: `ErrorNotEnoughAllowance()` (selector: `0xc2139725`)

**Check**:
```bash
cast call <token> "allowance(address,address)(uint256)" <user> <router> --rpc-url <RPC>
```

**Cause**: Frontend didn't execute approval transaction before/during order creation

**Debug flow**:
1. Check `authorizeInstructions` returns approval call:
```typescript
const [targets, data] = await router.authorizeInstructions([pullInstruction], userAddress);
```
2. Verify approval is in the transaction batch
3. Check if approval was actually executed on-chain

### 5. Flash Loan Lender Not Configured

**Symptom**: Adapter reverts on flash loan callback

**Check**:
```bash
cast call <Adapter> "allowedLenders(address)(bool)" <lenderAddress> --rpc-url <RPC>
cast call <Adapter> "getLenderType(address)(uint8)" <lenderAddress> --rpc-url <RPC>
# Type: 1=Aave, 2=Morpho
```

## Decoding Order Instructions

Use `scripts/decode-order.ts` to inspect stored order:

```bash
FORK_CHAIN=base MAINNET_FORKING_ENABLED=true npx hardhat run scripts/decode-order.ts --network hardhat
```

Key things to verify:
- PullToken user matches order creator
- PushToken target is KapanCowAdapter (for flash loan repayment)
- Borrow amount matches flash loan + fee
- DepositCollateral uses correct market context

## Testing Real Orders

The test file `test/v2/CowRealFlow.fork.ts` can simulate settling real orders:

```bash
FORK_CHAIN=base MAINNET_FORKING_ENABLED=true FORK_BLOCK=latest \
  npx hardhat test test/v2/CowRealFlow.fork.ts --grep "<order-id>"
```

### Test Structure

1. **Direct settle** (bypasses flash loan, better errors):
```typescript
await settlement.connect(solver).settle(tokens, prices, [trade], interactions);
```

2. **Full flash loan flow**:
```typescript
await flashLoanRouter.connect(solver).flashLoanAndSettle(loans, settlementCalldata);
```

If direct settle works but flash loan fails, the issue is in the flash loan callback chain.

## Hook Execution Flow

**Pre-hooks** (executed before swap):
1. `fundOrder(token, recipient, amount)` on Adapter - transfers flash-loaned tokens to OrderManager
2. `executePreHookBySalt(user, salt)` on OrderManager - runs pre-instructions (usually empty for flash loan orders)

**Post-hooks** (executed after swap):
1. `executePostHookBySalt(user, salt)` on OrderManager - runs post-instructions:
   - PullToken (user's margin)
   - Add (combine swap output + margin)
   - Approve (for lending protocol)
   - DepositCollateral (to Morpho/Aave)
   - Borrow (to repay flash loan)
   - PushToken (send borrowed tokens to Adapter for repayment)

## Flash Loan Repayment

For Morpho flash loans, the Adapter must have the borrowed amount + 0 fee (Morpho is free) to repay.

The post-hook borrows from user's position and pushes to Adapter:
```
User's Morpho Position → Borrow WETH → PushToken → KapanCowAdapter → repay Morpho
```

## Debugging Console Logs

The contracts have `console.log` statements. In fork tests:
```
fundOrder: START
fundOrder: amount = 18399910693677945
fundOrder: recipient = 0x12f80f5fff3c0ccc283c7b2a2cc9742ddf8c093a
fundOrder: adapter balance = 18399910693677945
fundOrder: COMPLETE
```

If you see `_executePostHook: router call FAILED with low-level error`, decode the selector:
```bash
cast 4byte <selector>
```

## Quick Diagnosis Checklist

1. [ ] OrderHandler set on OrderManager?
2. [ ] Order registered on ComposableCoW?
3. [ ] AppData registered with CoW API?
4. [ ] User approved Router for margin token?
5. [ ] User has credit delegation for borrow?
6. [ ] Flash loan lender allowed on Adapter?
7. [ ] VaultRelayer approved for sell token?
8. [ ] Receiver is OrderManager (not Settlement)?
